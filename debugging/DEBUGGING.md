# Debugging Analysis

Scenario 1: DELETE Employee Operation

Breakpoint:
userController.ts at const deletedEmployee = await userService.deleteEmployee(id);

Objective:
Ensure the employee with the given ID is deleted from the employees array.

Debugger Observations:

Variables:
id: Check if the passed ID matches the expected one (e.g., 1739468407652).
employees: Verify the employee exists before and is removed after deletion.
Call Stack:
Ensure the flow reaches deleteEmployeeById and deleteEmployee(id) correctly.
Behavior:
Confirm the employee is deleted from the array after the request.

Analysis

What did you learn from this scenario?

The debugger allows checking both the ID being passed for deletion and ensuring the employee’s removal from the list.
Did you observe any unexpected behavior?

 Potential issues could arise if the employee ID doesn't match or the array isn't correctly updated after deletion.
Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?

Ensure that proper error handling is implemented if the employee doesn’t exist or the deletion operation fails.
How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?

Understanding the debugging process for DELETE operations helps reinforce the importance of data consistency and correct handling of requests.

Scenario 2: POST Employee Creation Operation

Breakpoint:
userController.ts at const newEmployee: User = await userService.createEmployee(req.body);

Objective:
Ensure the correct data is passed to create a new employee.

Debugger Observations:

Variables:
req.body: Inspect the POST data (e.g., {"name": "John Doe", "position": "Software Engineer"}).
newEmployee: Verify the created employee object.
Call Stack:
Check that createEmployee is called after receiving the POST request.
Behavior:
Verify that the employee is created correctly by inspecting req.body and newEmployee.

Analysis

What did you learn from this scenario?

The debugger allows inspection of the incoming request data (req.body) and confirms whether the employee object is correctly created.
Did you observe any unexpected behavior?

If the newEmployee object doesn’t match the input data, check the userService.createEmployee logic for potential issues.
Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?

Ensure validation is in place to handle missing or incorrect data in req.body.
How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?

Debugging POST requests strengthens understanding of data validation and proper object creation workflows.

Scenario 3: POST Branch Creation Operation

Breakpoint:
branchController.ts at const newBranch: Branch = await branchService.createBranch(req.body);

Objective:
Ensure the branch data is correctly passed to create a new branch.

Debugger Observations:

Variables:
req.body: Inspect the branch data (e.g., {"name": "Main Branch", "address": "123 Main St"}).
newBranch: Ensure it includes correct details and a unique ID.
Call Stack:
Ensure the flow from the POST request to createBranch.
Behavior:
Verify the creation of the branch by inspecting req.body and newBranch.

Analysis

What did you learn from this scenario?

The debugger helps inspect the incoming request data (req.body) and verifies that the branch creation logic processes it correctly.
Did you observe any unexpected behavior?

If the branch creation fails, the issue may lie in the validation or creation logic in createBranch.
Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?

Ensure error handling is robust, especially for cases where required data is missing or invalid.
How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?

Debugging POST operations for branch creation improves understanding of managing data creation and validation for resources within the system.
