# Debugging Analysis

Scenario 1: DELETE Employee Operation

    Breakpoint Location: userController.ts, line where await userService.deleteEmployee(id); is called.
    Objective: Investigating the behavior when attempting to delete an employee from the system.

Debugger Observations

    Variable States:
        id = 1738992977390: Confirm the employee ID passed for deletion.
        employees array: Check the list of employees before deletion. The array should contain all employees, including the one with the ID 1738992977390.
    Call Stack: The call stack should show that the deleteEmployeeById function is being executed after receiving a DELETE request, which calls userService.deleteEmployee(id) and proceeds to delete the specified employee from the database or array.
    Behavior: Once the DELETE request is sent, the breakpoint is hit, allowing you to inspect the state of id and employees. At this point, the employee should still exist in the array before deletion, and after the deletion, it should no longer be present.

Analysis

    What did you learn from this scenario?
        This debugging process allows you to confirm that the employee deletion logic works as expected by ensuring the correct employee ID is being passed and that the employee is successfully removed from the array or database.
    Did you observe any unexpected behavior?
        If the employee is not removed from the array after the deleteEmployee call, this could indicate an issue with the deletion function in userService, such as a failure to update the employees array or an issue with database persistence.
    Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
        If the deletion process involves multiple steps (e.g., validation, logging, etc.), refactoring the function into smaller, more manageable parts could make it easier to troubleshoot in the future.
    How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
        Understanding how the delete operation works provides insights into the flow of employee management, especially in terms of handling data and ensuring successful modification of the employees array or database.

Scenario 2: POST Employee Creation Operation

    Breakpoint Location: userController.ts, line where const newEmployee: User = await userService.createEmployee(req.body); is called.
    Objective: Investigating the behavior when a new employee is created via the POST request.

Debugger Observations

    Variable States:
        req.body: Contains the data sent in the POST request, e.g., { "name": "John Doe", "position": "Software Engineer", "salary": 75000 }.
        newEmployee: This object should reflect the newly created employee, showing the correct properties that match the data sent in the request body.
    Call Stack: The call stack will show the sequence of function calls, including the POST request handler, followed by the createEmployee function call in the service layer that creates the new employee.
    Behavior: Once the POST request is sent with the new employee data, the breakpoint will trigger, allowing you to inspect the state of the request body (req.body) and the result of the employee creation (newEmployee). After the creation logic is executed, you should see the new employee object in the newEmployee variable.

Analysis

    What did you learn from this scenario?
        This scenario helps confirm that the POST request is correctly triggering the employee creation process and that the data is being handled as expected.
    Did you observe any unexpected behavior?
        If newEmployee does not reflect the correct employee data, it may suggest an issue with how the createEmployee function processes or stores the employee data. This could involve validation errors or issues with mapping the request body to the employee model.
    Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
        The logic for handling employee creation might benefit from error handling and validation improvements, ensuring that all necessary fields are provided and valid before attempting to create a new employee.
    How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
        Debugging this scenario gives you a better understanding of how the backend processes POST requests and creates new employee records. It emphasizes the importance of correctly handling input data and interacting with the database or data structure.
